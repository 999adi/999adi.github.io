**IT Blog**

Today's IT lesson was very different compared to the previous lessons as we didn’t learn about binary numbers but we were given an interesting session on improving our blogs and I learnt a lot.

Mr Keen showed us a website full of some very nice colour schemes and also told us it took a very long time to understand Github and to keep learning about how to improve our blogs. Last week I didn't put much effort into my blog and didn’t write much, however this week I’m going to improve my writing. I also need to change the colour of my writing on my blog because it isn’t very easy to read. I also learnt not to take shortcuts because there is no point doing something unless you aren’t giving it your best. 

I'm going to take away the very helpful pieces of advice I got from this lesson on improving my blog. I’m going to use the colour scheme website to get a nice background and I’m going to change the colours of the writing on my blog so it is easy to read. I also need to use the template which was added on Google Classroom to help me with the layout of my blogs. I’m going to view Mr Keen’s blog and use it as a guide to assist me with my blog but I won’t copy it.
