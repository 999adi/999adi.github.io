  <tr>
    <td>I focused on my work and did the questions fast as well as effectively. I didn't do much talking unless I was stuck. I used the tips on the side when my coding was incorrect and I didn’t stop working. The tips were very helpful as I wouldn’t know what was wrong in my coding without them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should have limited my talking to my partners as I could have maybe done my target for the lesson if I didn’t talk as much. In addition to this, me not getting my partner not to do my work for me when I was stuck would be better for me in the long run. This is  because, if I get the same problem again I’m going to have to ask my partner again however as I said above I will use the tips on the sides.</td>
